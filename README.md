# Petruk

Petruk is a java swing desktop app, developed specifically to assist translators and transcribers who need to do their
work in real-time.  With Petruk, a translator can create hotkeys to trigger common words and names as well as bits of
prepared text so that time is not wasted in typing.  It can be used in the real-time translations of plays or operas,
especially where characters names are known beforehand.  

Petruk was originally developed for Kitsie Emerson, to assist in her real-time translations of 
Javanese [wayang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang) (shadow puppet opera).
Here is a poor quality video of Petruk being used at a performance:
